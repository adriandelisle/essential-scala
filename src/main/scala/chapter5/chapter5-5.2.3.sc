  // 5.2.3.1 A Better Abstraction
  // We started developing an abstraction over sum, length, and product which
  // we sketched out as
  // def abstraction(end: Int, f: ???): Int =
  // this match {
  // case End => end
  // case Pair(hd, tl) => f(hd, tl.abstraction(end, f))
  //  }
  // Rename this function to fold, which is the name it is usually known as, and
  // finish the implementation.

      this match {

  // Is it more convenient to rewrite methods in terms of fold if they were implemented using pattern matching or
  // polymorphic? What does this tell us about the best use of fold?
  // Its easier to write with pattern matching.

  // Why canâ€™t we write our double method in terms of fold? Is it feasible we
  // could if we made some change to fold?
  // Folds as its written is limited to just Ints, not IntLists. If we used generics we could make it work.

  // Implement a generalised version of fold and rewrite double in terms of it.
